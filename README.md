## Advanced Configuration for Heurist Miners

### Command Line Interface (CLI) Options

#### Stable Diffusion Miner

When running the SD miner, you can use various CLI options to customize its behavior. You can combine multiple flags.

1. **Log Level**
   - Set the verbosity of log messages:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --log-level DEBUG
     ```
   - Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL (default: INFO)

2. **Auto-Confirm**
   - Automatically confirm model downloads:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --auto-confirm yes
     ```
   - Options: yes, no (default: no)

3. **Exclude SDXL**
   - Exclude SDXL models to reduce VRAM usage:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --exclude-sdxl
     ```

4. **Specify Model ID**
   - Run the miner with a specific model:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --model-id <model_id>
     ```
   - For example, run FLUX.1-dev model with:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --model-id FLUX.1-dev --skip-checksum
     ```

5. **CUDA Device ID**
   - Specify which GPU to use:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --cuda-device-id 0
     ```
6. **Skip checksum to speed up miner start-up time**
   - This skips checking the validity of model files. However, if incompleted files are present on the disk, the miner process will crash without this check.
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner.py --skip-checksum
     ```

#### Large Language Model Miner

For LLM miner, use the following CLI options to customize its behavior:

1. **Specify Model ID**
   - Run the miner with a specific model (mandatory):
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id>
     ```
   - Example: `dolphin-2.9-llama3-8b` (requires 24GB VRAM)

2. **Miner ID Index**
   - Specify which miner ID from the `.env` file to use:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --miner-id-index 1
     ```
   - Default: 0 (uses the first address configured)

3. **Port**
   - Set the port for communication with the vLLM process:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --port 8001
     ```
   - Default: 8000

4. **GPU IDs**
   - Specify which GPU(s) to use:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --gpu-ids 1
     ```
   - Default: 0

   - Example combining multiple options:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh dolphin-2.9-llama3-8b --miner-id-index 1 --port 8001 --gpu-ids 1
     ```

   - Advanced usage: To deploy large models using multiple GPUs on the same machine.
      ```bash
      ./llm-miner-starter.sh openhermes-mixtral-8x7b-gptq --miner-id-index 0 --port 8000 --gpu-ids 0,1
      ```

### Multiple GPU Configuration

To utilize multiple GPUs:

1. Assign unique Miner IDs in your `.env` file:
   ```
   MINER_ID_0=0xWalletAddress1
   MINER_ID_1=0xWalletAddress2
   ```
2. Set `num_cuda_devices` in `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [system]
   num_cuda_devices = 2
   ```
3. Run the miner without specifying a CUDA device ID to use all available GPUs.
